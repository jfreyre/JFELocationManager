                        JFELocationManager is a CLLocationManager wrapper that enable a really simple usage of location and heading update in your app instead of allocating a CLLocationManager object on each view.

                        * JFELocationManagerDelegate -> three methods that will be called on heading, location or status updates
                        * delegate vs importantDelegate -> be able to know if you have to stop background update or not
